# Assembly
Language of the Gods

The Lost Scrolls tell of the Time before Time. Back when fantastical creatures such as dragons, unicorns, centaurs, and platypuses roamed the Earth, there was a noble race of men called The Elders. The Elders spoke in the pure language of the Gods, handed down to them from Morgoth Bauglir. That language is called Assembly.

This repository contains my study of this ancient language. To master its arcane morphology and syntax, I have had to consult brittle scrolls, moth-eaten tomes, and cave hieroglyphics. For if I can master this language, I can rule the world!!
